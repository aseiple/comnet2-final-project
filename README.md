## TODO:

- [ ] **Router Code**
  - [ ] Add additional todos
 

- [ ] **Node Code**
  - [ ] Add additional todos


- [ ] **Guide/Readme**
  - How to run your program


- [ ] **Written Report**
  - Document for protocol implementation 
and  performance evaluation
  - Highlight your system design
  - Be concise. Focus on the core aspects that 
characterize  your implementation.
  - Clearly state design goals and ways how 
things are  accomplished. Use pictures to 
support the text.
  - May include, but not limited to following topics:
    - Software design description of all components
    - Routing protocols and algorithm implementation 
details
    - Performance estimation/evaluation
    - Router and host design details
    - Description of implemented classes and methods
    - Collected performance results

## Demo
- ~20 minutes per group
- Be ready to answer questions regarding your 
code  design
- The code should work on custom network topology 
(will  be provided before the demo)
- You should be able to showcase how routing 
tables are  built, what are the protocols used and 
what is the  performance
